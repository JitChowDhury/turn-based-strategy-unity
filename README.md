# Turn-Based Strategy (Unity)

A turn-based strategy game built in **Unity** to practice and demonstrate **advanced C# programming**, **clean architecture**, and **scalable game system design**.

This project focuses on writing **reusable, decoupled, and maintainable code**, inspired by grid-based tactical games such as XCOM-style and tactical RPGs.
